# Life Expectancy Prediction Using Linear Regression
In this hands-on project, we will train a Linear Regression model to predict life expectancy. The dataset was initially obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Websites. Data contains features such as year, status, life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, percentage of expenditure, and alcohol consumption.
